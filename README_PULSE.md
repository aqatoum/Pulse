## How to Explore the Project (Recommended Order)

1. **Start with `PULSE_CODEX/`**  
   This folder defines what the system is, what it is not, and the rules it follows.  
   If anything conflicts with the Codex, the Codex wins.

2. **Read `docs/Methodology.md`**  
   Explains the analytical logic, evaluation approach, and research framing.

3. **Explore `apps/`**  
   Review the backend analytics and frontend dashboards.

4. **Use `data/` samples**  
   Run demos or validate signal behavior using realistic, non-identifiable datasets.

## Signature Insight

PULSE does not monitor diseases.  
It listens early to population physiology using routine laboratory signals—  
detecting meaningful deviations before diagnoses accumulate.

---

## License & Use

This repository is intended for research, evaluation, and pilot purposes.  
Any deployment involving real institutional data must comply with applicable ethical and regulatory approvals.
