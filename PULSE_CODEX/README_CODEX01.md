# PULSE Codex  
**Single Source of Truth**

This folder contains the official governing documents of the PULSE project.

The PULSE Codex defines the **non-negotiable scope, boundaries, architectural decisions, ethical constraints, and design rules** that govern the system. These documents are authoritative and take precedence over any other description, discussion, or implementation detail found elsewhere in the repository.

---

## What the Codex Is

- The formal definition of what PULSE **is** and **is not**
- The ethical and governance framework of the system
- The reference for all architectural, analytical, and UI decisions
- The standard against which changes are evaluated

If any code, documentation, or discussion conflicts with the Codex, **the Codex wins**.

---

## What the Codex Is NOT

- ❌ Not an introductory overview (see `README.md`)
- ❌ Not marketing or promotional material
- ❌ Not optional guidance
- ❌ Not implementation-specific code documentation

The Codex exists to **protect the integrity, scope, and trustworthiness** of the project.

## Who Should Read This Folder

- Researchers and academic reviewers  
- System architects and developers  
- Ethics, governance, or compliance reviewers  
- Institutional partners evaluating pilots or deployment  

Casual readers should start with `README.md` instead.

---

## Change Control (Critical)

Any meaningful change to:
- scope,
- analytics logic,
- ethical boundaries,
- governance rules,
- UI or reporting standards

**must be explicitly documented** in the relevant Codex file.

Silent or undocumented changes are not permitted.

---

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- `README.md`  
  → Entry point and high-level overview

- `docs/`  
  → Explanatory and research-oriented material

- `apps/`  
  → Implementation (backend and frontend)

- `data/`  
  → Non-identifiable datasets for demo and validation

The Codex governs all of the above.

## Guiding Principle

PULSE is a population-level early-warning system.  
It is not a diagnostic tool, not a clinical decision engine,  
and not a replacement for existing health systems.

The Codex exists to ensure this principle is never violated.
