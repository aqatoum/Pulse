# PULSE — Official Pitch Kit (Competition / Master’s / Pilot)

## 1) One-Sentence Value Proposition
PULSE is a population-level laboratory surveillance platform that detects early physiological signals using routine lab data, enabling earlier public-health awareness without diagnosis or clinical intrusion.

---

## 2) The Problem (Why it matters)
- Public-health surveillance often relies on delayed case reporting.
- Early physiological changes in populations remain unnoticed despite existing laboratory data.
- Decision-makers lack early, explainable, and ethical warning signals.

---

## 3) The Solution (What PULSE does)
- Ingests routine laboratory results already being collected.
- Aggregates data ethically at population level.
- Applies validated statistical methods (EWMA, CUSUM, Farrington).
- Presents calm, explainable dashboards and reports for experts.

---

## 4) Why This Is Different
- Laboratory-first, not diagnosis-first.
- Early signal detection before confirmed cases accumulate.
- Explainable analytics, not black-box AI.
- Built-in governance, ethics, and transparency.

---

## 5) Evidence of Feasibility
- Working backend (data ingestion, analytics, APIs).
- Functional frontend (dashboards, reports, bilingual UI).
- Stable analytical outputs aligned with documented contracts.
- Demo-ready data and workflows.

---

## 6) Target Use Cases
- Public health monitoring
- Early nutritional deficiency detection
- Research and policy planning
- Institutional pilot deployments

---

## 7) Ethical & Governance Safeguards
- No individual diagnosis or treatment guidance.
- Aggregated, anonymized outputs only.
- Transparent methods and audit indicators.
- Human-in-the-loop interpretation.

---

## 8) Why This Fits a Master’s Program
- Strong methodological foundation (statistics + digital health).
- Real-world system design and evaluation.
- Clear research questions (sensitivity, timeliness, stability).
- Direct pathway to applied research and thesis work.

---

## 9) Demo in 60 Seconds (Verbal)
“Using routine lab data, PULSE aggregates population signals weekly.
Here, we see a sustained deviation detected using EWMA—before any formal diagnosis spike.
The system explains the method, shows limitations, and generates a narrative report.
No patient data, no diagnosis—just early awareness.”

---

## 10) What Comes Next
- Pilot with real institutional data.
- Formal evaluation study.
- Feature expansion under strict governance.

---

## Signature Insight (What makes PULSE unforgettable)
PULSE does not monitor diseases.
It listens early to population physiology using routine laboratory signals,
detecting meaningful deviations before diagnoses accumulate.

In other words:
PULSE listens to the body of a community, not just its reported illnesses.
