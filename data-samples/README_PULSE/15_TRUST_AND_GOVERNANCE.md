# PULSE — Trust, Transparency & Governance Indicators

## Governance Philosophy
PULSE operates as a population-level analytical decision-support system.
Trust is built through transparency, traceability, and clear methodological boundaries.

---

## Mandatory Trust Indicators (UI-Level)

Every dashboard and report must display:
- Data time range
- Aggregation level (e.g., weekly)
- Last data update timestamp
- Signal methodology used (EWMA / CUSUM / Farrington)

---

## Method Transparency
- Users must be able to access a plain-language explanation of:
  - How signals are computed
  - What baselines represent
  - What alerts do and do not mean

No method should function as a “black box”.

---

## Data Provenance
- Clearly state:
  - Data source type (routine laboratory data)
  - Aggregation scope (population-level)
- No reference to individual patient records.

---

## Audit & Traceability

### Required Audit Elements
- Report generation timestamp
- Parameters used (facility, time range, signal type)
- Version of analytical logic (if applicable)

### Purpose
Enable internal review, reproducibility, and accountability.

---

## Alert Governance
- Alerts are informational signals, not action mandates.
- No automated enforcement or policy action is triggered by the system.
- Human expert interpretation is always required.

---

## Ethical Boundary Reinforcement
Every report and dashboard must reinforce:
- Non-diagnostic nature
- Absence of clinical decision-making
- Population-level scope only

---

## Change Accountability
- All methodological, UI, or governance changes must be logged in Decision Records.
- Silent changes are not permitted.
