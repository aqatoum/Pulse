# PULSE — Narrative Reports Standard

## Purpose of Narrative Reports
Narrative reports translate analytical signals into structured, human-readable summaries
for decision-makers, without performing diagnosis or clinical interpretation.

---

## Mandatory Report Structure (All Languages)

### 1) Report Header
- Signal name
- Facility / region
- Time range
- Report generation date

---

### 2) Executive Summary (Mandatory)
- One short paragraph answering:
  “What is happening at the population level?”

Rules:
- Neutral tone
- No speculation
- No medical advice

Example (EN):
"During the past four weeks, the analyzed laboratory data indicate a sustained elevation
in anemia-related population signals compared to the established baseline."

---

### 3) Key Observations
- Bullet points summarizing:
  - Direction of change (increase / decrease / stable)
  - Duration of deviation
  - Affected population segments (if applicable)

Rules:
- Observations must be directly supported by data.
- No interpretation beyond observed patterns.

---

### 4) Analytical Context
- Methods used (EWMA, CUSUM, Farrington — if applicable)
- Baseline definition
- Aggregation level (weekly)

Purpose:
Explain *how* the signal was detected, not *why* it occurred.

---

### 5) Data Limitations & Notes (Mandatory)
- Data completeness issues (if any)
- Small sample warnings
- Known constraints affecting interpretation

Example:
"Results should be interpreted with caution due to limited data volume
during the selected time period."

---

### 6) Closing Statement
- Reinforce non-diagnostic nature
- Encourage contextual expert review

Example:
"This report provides population-level analytical indicators and does not
constitute clinical diagnosis or treatment guidance."

---

## Empty Report Rule (Critical)
A narrative report must NEVER be empty.

If insufficient data:
- Clearly state:
  EN: "Insufficient data to generate a narrative summary for the selected parameters."
  AR: "لا تتوفر بيانات كافية لإنشاء ملخص سردي للمعايير المختارة."

---

## Language Rules
- Apply Microcopy & i18n Rules strictly.
- Arabic and English reports must convey identical meaning.
- No automated phrasing without human-readable structure.

---

## Formatting Rules
- Paragraph-based (no long blocks)
- Clear spacing
- No emojis, icons, or decorative elements
