# PULSE — Microcopy & Bilingual Language Rules (AR / EN)

## Core Language Philosophy
- Language must be calm, neutral, and professional.
- Avoid alarmist, emotional, or sensational wording.
- Text should support decision-making, not provoke reaction.

---

## Medical Wording Rules
- Use “signal”, “indicator”, or “deviation” — never “diagnosis” or “disease”.
- Use “suggests” or “indicates” — never “confirms” or “proves”.
- Avoid absolute terms unless mathematically true.

---

## English Style Rules
- Short, clear sentences.
- Active voice preferred.
- No jargon without explanation.
- Consistent terminology across screens.

Example:
- ✅ “Sustained deviation detected over the past 3 weeks.”
- ❌ “A serious abnormality has been found.”

---

## Arabic Style Rules
- Use Modern Standard Arabic (واضحة وبسيطة).
- Avoid classical exaggeration or rhetorical tone.
- Prefer clarity over eloquence.

Examples:
- ✅ “لوحظ انحراف مستمر في المؤشر خلال الأسابيع الثلاثة الماضية.”
- ❌ “تم اكتشاف خلل خطير وغير مسبوق.”

---

## Bilingual Consistency Rule (Critical)
- Arabic and English texts must convey the SAME meaning.
- Avoid literal word-for-word translation.
- Medical meaning takes precedence over linguistic symmetry.

---

## Status & Alert Messaging
- Stable:
  - EN: “Within expected range.”
  - AR: “ضمن النطاق المتوقع.”
- Attention:
  - EN: “Above expected baseline.”
  - AR: “أعلى من خط الأساس المتوقع.”
- Alert:
  - EN: “Sustained deviation detected.”
  - AR: “تم رصد انحراف مستمر.”

---

## Empty & Error Messaging
- Messages must explain the situation, not blame the system or user.
- Never expose technical stack details.

---

## Dates, Numbers, Units
- Numbers remain unchanged across languages.
- Date format adapts to language direction.
- Units must always be explicit.

---

## Forbidden Language
- Panic-inducing terms
- Emojis
- Casual or conversational phrasing
- Abbreviations without explanation
