# PULSE — Design Tokens (Medical-Grade UI)

## Color System (Medical & Trust-Oriented)

### Primary Colors
- Primary Blue: Used for primary actions, headers, and key indicators.
  - Meaning: trust, stability, clinical authority.
- Secondary Teal/Green: Used for supportive indicators and positive states.
  - Meaning: health, balance, reassurance.

### Neutral Colors
- Background: soft off-white / light gray (never pure white).
- Text Primary: near-black (high contrast, low eye strain).
- Text Secondary: muted gray for metadata and explanations.
- Borders & Dividers: very light gray, minimal visibility.

### Alert Colors (Use Sparingly)
- Warning: amber/yellow (attention without panic).
- Alert: muted red (serious deviation, not alarmist).
- Never use bright or saturated red for non-critical UI.

## Typography System

### Font Philosophy
- Use a modern, human-readable sans-serif font.
- The font must support Arabic and English equally well.
- Avoid decorative or playful fonts.

### Hierarchy
- Page Title: large, calm, low weight.
- Section Header: clear, structured, medium weight.
- Body Text: readable, relaxed line spacing.
- Numeric Values: clear and consistent, never cramped.

## Spacing & Layout

### Spacing Rules
- Use generous whitespace.
- Prefer vertical rhythm over dense horizontal packing.
- Sections must visually “breathe”.

### Grid Principles
- Consistent grid across all dashboards.
- Alignment is more important than decoration.
- Charts and cards must align perfectly.

---

## Components Style Rules

### Cards
- Flat or very subtle elevation.
- Rounded corners are minimal and consistent.
- No heavy shadows.

### Charts
- Clean axes, no visual noise.
- Labels must be readable without zooming.
- Baselines and thresholds must be visually distinct but subtle.

### Buttons
- One primary action per screen.
- Secondary actions visually quieter.
- No icon-only buttons for critical actions.

---

## Interaction & Motion

### Motion Rules
- Motion is functional, not decorative.
- Subtle transitions only (fade, short slide).
- No bouncing, scaling, or playful effects.

---

## Design Consistency Rule (Critical)
Any new UI component must:
- Use the same colors
- Use the same spacing
- Follow the same typography hierarchy

If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t ship.
