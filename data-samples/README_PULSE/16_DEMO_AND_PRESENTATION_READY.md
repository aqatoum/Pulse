# PULSE — Demo & Presentation Readiness Checklist

## Demo Objective
Demonstrate that PULSE:
- Detects population-level signals earlier than diagnosis-based reporting
- Is ethical, explainable, and non-intrusive
- Is ready for real-world institutional use

---

## Standard Demo Flow (10–12 minutes)

### Step 1 — Context (1 minute)
- What problem exists in current surveillance?
- Why laboratory-first early-warning matters.

### Step 2 — Overview Dashboard (2 minutes)
- Show calm vs deviation state
- Highlight trust indicators (time range, aggregation, update time)

### Step 3 — Signal Deep Dive (4 minutes)
- Open one signal (e.g., anemia)
- Explain trend, baseline, and persistence
- Show EWMA/CUSUM outputs
- Emphasize non-diagnostic nature

### Step 4 — Narrative Report (2 minutes)
- Generate report
- Read executive summary
- Point out limitations section

### Step 5 — Governance & Ethics (1–2 minutes)
- Show methodology page
- Reinforce boundaries and human-in-the-loop design

---

## Demo Data Rules
- Use realistic but non-identifiable data
- Avoid extreme spikes unless explained
- Prefer sustained subtle deviations over dramatic anomalies

---

## Presentation Language Rules
- Speak calmly and precisely
- Avoid buzzwords unless asked
- Use “indicates”, “suggests”, “supports awareness”

---

## Common Questions & Prepared Answers

### “Is this diagnosing disease?”
Answer:
“No. The system provides population-level analytical signals, not individual diagnosis or clinical decisions.”

### “Can this replace existing systems?”
Answer:
“No. It operates as an analytical overlay without interfering with current workflows.”

### “Why is this better than case reporting?”
Answer:
“It listens to population physiology earlier, using data that already exists.”
